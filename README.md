# Assignment Overview: Lab 5

## My Task: Writing Code On Branches

In this lab I learned how to fork and clone a GitHub repo, and then create solutions to some code problems such that my solutions passed the included tests.

**Here are a couple of things I had to keep in mind:**

* I avoided placing extra function calls in my code. I learned to run tests by hand from the console. This gave me additional practice using the console and practice of efficient app-switching processes.
* I created a new branch for each code problem, merged each branch into *master* on GitHub, and then pulled the updated master branch into my local master branch each time I merged a pull request. I continued the process of creating a new branch from master for the next problem.
